I think you may have figured out our secret, haha. To compensate for our shit work culture, we have quite a few public holidays. Just last year our government finalized a new holiday (mountain day, 8/11) and that topped up our number to 16 days per year. Notable ones include children’s day (5/5), spring equinox day (on the date of the spring equinox), emperor’s birthday (currently 12/23). Golden Week (late april to may) is really popular for vacations. It’s when there’s about four public holidays consecutively or almost consecutively, and it’s standard practice for many companies to just let everyone take the whole week off. Next popular is Obon (mid august for usually a little less than a week) which was not even a public holiday until Mountain’s Day came along, but it originated as a day to pray for our ancestors. Today, many people will return to their hometowns for that tradition, and some people may travel for fun. It’s actually kind of cool to be in Tokyo during Obon, since everyone who came from a different prefecture all leave Tokyo for that time. The amount of time people get off for obon depends on the company (as does with golden week to an extent). People traditionally go home for new years as well. As for overseas travel vs domestic travel, (I looked it up!) japanese people on average take 1.4 for-pleasure overnight trips, 1.6 for-pleasure day trips, and 0.1 for-pleasure international trips (ie, in general one in ten people take an international trip per year).
