# Building meguna.co: A Fun Journey with React and Node

Building my own portfolio/blog website has always been on the back of my mind. After [briefly flirting with a terrible Angular implementation]() of one, I decided to go back to the drawing board. The website you are looking at now is the final result. 

## Defining the Purpose

My main goal with this project was to create a space where I could showcase, document, and comment on my work. This meant that I needed a structure where I could post writings (short blog posts noting code techniques or discoveries) and curated projects (past work). The website ideally were to accomplish this while also representing my skills and personality in a deliberate way, since viewers would naturally draw parallels between the website and the identity behind it. I sought to present a strong, cohesive design along with snappy and responsive functionality. 

## Tech Stack and Tools

* **front end:** React

I narrowed my decision down to either React and Angular for the frontend since I wanted to get the practice of using a popular and in-demand framework. I ended up choosing React because I personally found it to be more intuitive and I preferred JSX over Typescript. 

* **back end:** Node + Express.js

I knew that my backend would probably consist of a very simple REST API that retrieved information from a database of blog posts. I went with Node and Express because of how lightweight they are. 

* **database:** mySQL

As mentioned previously, I didnâ€™t have too many demands for the database. I chose mySQL because I was the most experienced with it at the time. 

* **tools:** of course, I used Git for basic version control and Travis for deployment. 


## Setting it Up

I initially [had some difficulty]() setting up my Nginx server blocks to host both my backend REST API and the frontend of the website itself.
