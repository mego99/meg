By far the hardest thing about getting this website up was configuration. I only bought one domain on Digital Ocean, and I needed to host both an API (that communicates with my MySQL database) and the React app that serves the website itself. Considering I was equipped with a pretty poor understanding of how ports worked, this took me ages to figure out. 

Hereâ€™s my successful nginx config file in all its glory: 

	upstream api {
		    server 127.0.0.1:8080;
	}
	
	server {
		    listen 80;
		    listen [::]:80;
	
		    ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem;
	
		    root /var/www/meguna.co/build;
		    index index.html index.htm;
	
		    server_name meguna.co www.meguna.co;
	
		    location / {
		            root /var/www/meguna.co/build;
		            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
		    }
	
		    location /api {
		            rewrite ^api/(.*)$ /api/$1 break;
		            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
		            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
		            proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;
		            proxy_set_header X-Ssl on;
	
		            proxy_pass http://api;
		            proxy_redirect    off;
		    }
			  (certbot stuff here)
	}
