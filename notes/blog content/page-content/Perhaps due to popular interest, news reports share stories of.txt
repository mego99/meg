## An Examination on Possible Sources of Immorality

Unrelenting stories of violent rape, torture, abuse, and other examples of heinous conduct permeate today’s news reports.  What motivates people to commit these crimes? Is everyone equally capable of these acts, or are some people more predisposed to those than others? This paper will examine historical, experimental, theological, and psychological perspectives on this age-old question through two conceptual approaches: that of human nature and that of situational and psychological factors. 

There is no single consensus on what constitutes an “immoral” or “evil” act. This paper employs an universalist understanding of morality, or the position that “there is a universal ethic which applies to all people.” In particular, common themes from legal systems across societies are used to establish a loose guideline, and all featured examples of immorality are those that are widely considered crimes in modern society. Although this definition is far from exhaustive, it is adequate for the scope of this paper because it supplies clear and concrete  

## Human Nature and Moral Predisposition

One popular way to define the source of morality is by anchoring it to human nature. These theories posit that humans are either inherently good, inherently bad, or either of the two depending on the individual. In other words, humans are born with a predisposition towards some level of “goodness” or “badness.” Thomas Hobbes was a famous proponent of the idea that humans are fundamentally wicked, and claimed that when left in a “state of nature,” human life would be “nasty, brutish and short.” On the other end of the spectrum, thinkers such as Locke and Rousseau suggested that humans were naturally moral or virtuous, and based their political theories on this assumption. 

Different belief systems around the world have adopted this approach. In many sects of Christianity, the doctrine of Original Sin preaches that the human soul is inherently corrupted, because all humans inherited the sinfulness from Adam’s act of disobedience in the Garden of Eden. Other aspects of this religion are dependent on this fact; the existence of Original Sin legitimizes God’s role as a savior. This popularized the idea of humans being inherently bad in the Western world. In the East, Xunzi of Han China held a similar belief, arguing that “human nature lacks an innate moral compass.”

Some researchers have taken historical and anthropological approaches to evaluating human nature, often pointing to the human tendency towards violence as a sign of an inherently “bad” nature. Studies conducted by the University of Grenada have shown that humans are six times more likely to kill each other than other mammals, with the most violent periods of human history being the Post Classic era (1200 CE onwards). In a different study, Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham examined the evolutionary history of both humans and chimpanzees, concluding that men with a higher propensity for lethal aggression (“the experience of a victory thrill, an enjoyment of the chase, a tendency for easy dehumanization”) have greater reproductive success. His research suggests that 


## Situational and Psychological Factors

In the past seventy or so years, numerous experiments have been conducted by psychologists probing the prevalence of “evil” in high-pressure situations. Instead of considering morality as a fixed component of human nature, these people imagined it as a result of varying situational and psychological factors. The most prominent of these is the controversial 1971 Stanford prison experiment conducted by psychologist Philip Zimbardo. In this experiment, volunteers were randomly assigned “prisoner” or “guard” roles in a mock dungeon setting and were observed over a six day period. Over the course of the experiment, many of the “guards” sadistically escalated their aggression beyond original terms. Zimbardo concluded that the situation and role experienced by a person can have profound effects on their behavior. 

Zimbardo’s findings are similar to those of his predecessors.  Stanley Milgram conducted similarly controversial experiments where subjects complied when asked to administer increasingly damaging physical punishments on actors; Hannah Arendt examined a prominent Nazi leader and concluded that he was a “thoughtless bureaucrat” who had succumbed to the “banality of evil.” Their conclusions were similar: under sufficient pressure, people are capable of the most savage behavior. 

Today, all three of their claims are contested by researchers who note major inconsistencies or malpractices in their experiments. Notions of morality, however, that are at least partially built up through situational and psychological processes, continues to be explored in other ways. Albert Bandura, a psychologist at Stanford, suggests that people use these processes to legitimize behavior that they themselves perceive as immoral, terming the phenomenon “selective moral disengagement.” These processes include

## Concluding Remarks

While there is no single consensus on how to examine the root causes of human immorality, it remains a fact that human life will be intertwined with immorality for the foreseeable future. As Hobbes and Locke demonstrate with their debate on how society should be managed, a cohesive understanding of what drives “bad” behavior fundamentally shapes our societal structures. From the classification and codification of crime, the establishment of checks and balances, and
