## The Setup

The scene is pretty simple:

- a grid array cloner with a bunch of different solids
	- some of the platonic solids have bevel deformers 
	- MoGraph random effector adjusting position and rotation
- two area lights
- a sky object
	- its material has a luminance channel with a free HDR from [HDR Labs](http://www.hdrlabs.com/sibl/archive/downloads/Chiricahua_NarrowPath.zip)
- cameras with a low f-stop
