#### Objective

The purpose of this website is to display some of the work that I’ve been doing so far, using a blog-style post to describe each project. Some of the projects are hosted on subdomains here while others are on Github Pages.

This website has been about two years in the making, slowly put together between coursework and projects and other responsibilities. I am certain it will continue to evolve along with my skills and taste.

#### Implemented Features
Well, you’re looking at it!

* simple blog posts generated from imported markdown documents
* customizable image layout on post pages
* canvas shader on index page
* clean, intuitive, and cohesive design

#### Gradual Evolution
When I started the project in 2017, I had barely any experience with writing Javascript-based web applications. I chose to set up my website with Angular 4 and soon enough the first iteration of the website was complete. The code was messy and the design was amateurish.

Later I scrapped what I had so far and started from scratch using React. This version was organized slightly better and drew upon a stronger understanding of coding principles. It still had its shortcomings, namely in that it overcomplicated the goal of displaying my work. Everything was stored meticulously in a database, and there was little flexibility in the presentation of each project. 

In essence, all I was doing was setting up a custom CMS solution. I realized that I wasn’t going to showcase hundreds or even tens of projects, and instead wanted to cherry pick a few here or there and showcase them in the best light possible. I stepped back and refocused on building an app that prioritized easy updates, flexible presentation, and simplicity above all.

The current iteration of the website my attempt at doing that while still reusing a lot of code from my previous iterations due to time constraints. 
 
#### Next Steps

Right now, my focus is on expanding the breadth of my coding projects and trying out new things. In the future I believe these new skills will be incorporated into this website as well, much like how the canvas shader came about from my exploration with data visualization.
